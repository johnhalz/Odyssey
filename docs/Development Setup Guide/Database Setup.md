# Database Setup

Odyssey uses a Postgres database to store data. Currently, it is recommended to use Docker to set up a Postgres database. You can use the following command to create a Postgres database in Docker:

``` bash
docker run --name odyssey -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=odysseypassword -d -p 5432:5432 postgres
```

You can set the password to the database by setting the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` field.

!!! note

    If you change the value of `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, you will also need to edit this value in the `Odyssey/settings.py` file (lines 79 - 88).

Now that you have your database, you can move onto setting up your [python development environment](./Python%20Environment%20Setup.md)!

# API Usage & Documentation

Odyssey has an extensive REST API that gives developers the ability to integrate it into apps of their choosing. The full documentation of this api is available at: http://localhost:8000/api/schema/swagger-ui/

## Usage the API in Other Languages

Currently, there are no existing packages that can be easily downloaded that interface with Odyssey’s API. They are coming soon though! Packages for the following languages are planned for development though:

- Python
- Swift
- Rust

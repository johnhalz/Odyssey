# Odyssey Documentation

## Description
Odyssey is a proposal for a modern database structure for hardware production. Thanks to itâ€™s flexible structure, it can accommodate almost any hardware production line with the ability to:

- Save data about produced hardware
- Keep track of progress
- Give users the ability to view live data and control different elements of a production line
- Save processes, test results
- Keep track of defined specifications and non-compliances
